            Granny's Diner has been serving this community with our world famous chocolat chip 
            cookies for over 10,000 years. BTW, we cater! Our catering is rated a -2 out of 10 
            according to the world catering administration. Although our kitchen is very unsanitary, 
            only 15 out of 20 people experience food poisoning and flop dead. These rates are better 
            than 2% of all restaurants in North Korea. <br> <br>
